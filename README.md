## REGISTER NUMBER: 212223240024

## Aim

To write prompts for different prompt types and compare them across AI tools, then evaluate them using a rubric.

## Scenario & Use Case

Scenario: The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance.

Target Audience: Manufacturing companies in automotive, electronics, and food processing sectors.

## Objectives:

Improve production efficiency by 30%.

Minimize downtime using predictive maintenance.

Enable real-time monitoring and remote control.

Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.

Prompts for Each Type
# 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt

Definition: Asking for a comparison between two or more concepts.
Prompt:
“Compare and contrast traditional manual monitoring in manufacturing with IoT-enabled predictive maintenance in terms of efficiency, cost, and downtime.”

# 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt

Definition: Asking from the perspective of a specific role.
Prompt:
“As a factory manager, how would IoT-based predictive maintenance change your day-to-day operations compared to manual supervision?”

# 3. Everyday Functioning Prompt

Definition: Relating technology to everyday functioning.
Prompt:
“How does predictive maintenance in manufacturing work similarly to how car owners use service reminders or health apps track fitness?”

# 4. Universal Prompt Structure

Definition: Generalized templates like “Explain X with an example.”
Prompt:
“Explain predictive maintenance in simple terms with a step-by-step example from a manufacturing assembly line.”

# 5. Prompt Size Limitations

Definition: Large prompts broken into chunks.
Prompt:
“List 30 real-world applications of IoT in manufacturing. Give me 10 applications at a time with a brief explanation of each.”

| Criteria         | Description                                                 | Example |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Clarity**      | Is the prompt clear and unambiguous?                        | 5       |
| **Relevance**    | Is it aligned with the use case (manufacturing automation)? | 5       |
| **Depth**        | Does it encourage detailed AI responses?                    | 4       |
| **Practicality** | Can the output be applied in real-world context?            | 5       |
| **Scalability**  | Can it adapt for larger queries (size limitations)?         | 4       |

| Prompt Type  | Clarity | Relevance | Depth | Practicality | Scalability | Avg Score |
| ------------ | ------- | --------- | ----- | ------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| Comparative  | 5       | 5         | 4     | 5            | 4           | 4.6       |
| Experiential | 5       | 5         | 4     | 5            | 3           | 4.4       |
| Everyday     | 4       | 4         | 3     | 4            | 3           | 3.6       |
| Universal    | 5       | 5         | 4     | 5            | 4           | 4.6       |
| Size Limit   | 4       | 5         | 4     | 5            | 5           | 4.6       |

## Result

The various types of prompts (Comparative, Experiential, Everyday Functioning, Universal, and Size Limitation) were successfully generated and evaluated using rubrics. The evaluation shows that Comparative, Universal, and Size-Limited prompts performed best for clarity and practical AI outputs.
